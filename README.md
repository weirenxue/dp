# Design Pattern

---

1. Creational patterns

    Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of exisiting code.

    1. [Builder](./creational/builder/): When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.
    1. [Factory](./creational/factories/): A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
    1. [Prototype](./creational/prototype/): A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
    1. [Singleton](./creational/singleton/): A component which is instantiated only once.

1. Structural patterns

    Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

    1. [Adapter](./structural/adapter/): A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
    1. [Bridge](./structural/bridge/): A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).
    1. [Composite](./structural/composite/): A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
    1. [Decorator](./structural/decorator/): Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects through embedding.
    1. [Facade](./structural/facade/): Provides a simple, easy to understand/use interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.
    1. [Flyweight](./structural/flyweight/): A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.
    1. [Proxy](./structural/proxy/): A type that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.

1. Behavioral patterns

    Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

    1. [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/chain_of_responsibility/)
    1. [Command](./behavioral/command/)
    1. [Interpreter](./behavioral/interpreter/)
    1. [Iterator](./behavioral/iterator/)
    1. [Mediator](./behavioral/mediator/)
    1. [Memento](./behavioral/memento/)
    1. [Observer](./behavioral/observer/)
    1. [State](./behavioral/state/)
    1. [Strategy](./behavioral/strategy/)
    1. [Template Method](./behavioral/template_method/)
    1. [Visitor](./behavioral/visitor/)
