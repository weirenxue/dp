# Design Pattern

---

1. Creational patterns:

    Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of exisiting code.

    1. [Builder](./creational/builder/): When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.
    1. [Factory](./creational/factories/): A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
    1. [Prototype](./creational/prototype/): A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
    1. [Singleton](./creational/singleton/): A component which is instantiated only once.

1. Structural patterns:

    Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

    1. [Adapter](./structural/adapter/)
    1. [Bridge](./structural/bridge/)
    1. [Composite](./structural/composite/)
    1. [Decorator](./structural/decorator/)
    1. [Facade](./structural/facade/)
    1. [Flyweight](./structural/flyweight/)
    1. [Proxy](./structural/proxy/)

1. Behavioral patterns:

    Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

    1. [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/chain_of_responsibility/)
    1. [Command](./behavioral/command/)
    1. [Interpreter](./behavioral/interpreter/)
    1. [Iterator](./behavioral/iterator/)
    1. [Mediator](./behavioral/mediator/)
    1. [Memento](./behavioral/memento/)
    1. [Observer](./behavioral/observer/)
    1. [State](./behavioral/state/)
    1. [Strategy](./behavioral/strategy/)
    1. [Template Method](./behavioral/template_method/)
    1. [Visitor](./behavioral/visitor/)
